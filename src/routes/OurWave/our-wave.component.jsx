                    <p>
                        The organization was started in 2018 with the goal of providing individuals with a space where they might find common ground with others, and where they could speak about traumatic past experiences rather than internalize the associated negative emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We help survivors find hope and connection on the path to healing:
